my repos:

- https://github.com/jtirana98/decFLwithSL : old implementation, but it contains an example on networking
- https://github.com/jtirana98/NIID-Bench-adhocSL : it extends the NIID-Bench library from the flower, that contains the training of several distributed learning frameworks and different types of non-iid
- https://github.com/jtirana98/MultiHop-Federeated-Split-Learning : implementation of parallel Split Learning with LibTorch, i.e., C++
